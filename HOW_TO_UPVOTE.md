# How to upvote an issue
If you’d like to add your interest to a particular issue, you can do so by upvoting it. **Before you upvote**, please take a moment to read our document on [how we prioritize issues](HOW_WE_PRIORITIZE.md), so you can better understand what happens with your vote.

1) Make sure you are logged into GitHub (https://github.com). If you do not have an account, you will have to register one first.
2) Go to Resonite issues GitHub repository here: https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues
3) Find the issue that you would like to vote for and open it by clicking on its title
4) Scroll to the bottom of the very first post of the issue (not to the bottom of the whole page!)
5) Click on the smiley face in the lower left corner
6) Click on the “Thumbs up” icon - the very first in the list

You are done! You have added your vote to the issue
