# Best practices for bug reporting
**Please ensure the following requirements are met** for any bug reports submitted to this repository:
- **Use the most recent version of Resonite** when replicating your issues (this helps ensure that issues are still relevant and replicable)
- **Try to search for existing issues** describing your problem before creating a new one (if an issue already exists for what you wish to report, please add to the existing issue instead)
- **Focus on the high level issue first, not specific solution** as this lets us approach the problem in most efficient way. E.g. it's better to create issue saying "I can't do X", rather than "Add component that when this and this it does this". Often there are many different solutions to a problem and if you ask us to implement a very specific solution, instead about asking the problem you're trying to solve, you're more likely to get a lot of questions and possibly no. To learn more, check this page about the XY Problem: https://xyproblem.info/
- **Do not hijack issues for another feature/bug**, make another issue instead. Issues should never have comments of type "While you're at it, can you also do this?", it will not be considered and will get lost when the original problem in the issue gets solved
- **Provide a link** (public folder or world) to content that replicates the issue (ensure replication worlds have their metadata set to allow access from anyone)
- **Try to troubleshoot** and isolate the problem first before reporting it (e.g. if it is a complex ProtoFlux creation try to identify the specific node/node group that is not behaving as expected- strip down as much as possible from the item/world while still producing the bug)
- **Provide a clean log file** from replicating the issue (**DO NOT USE MODS OR PLUGINS**, launch the client, load the replication item/world, replicate the issue, and exit)
- **Report which version** of the app the problem was first observed on, as well as other relevant information (your OS, hardware, etc. as specified in the issue template)
- **Use objective, and respectful language** for any posts/comments submitted (negativity, hateful/angry issues/comments are liable to be edited or removed)
- **Use short, but descriptive tittle** as vague titles (e.g. "Issue with system" instead of "System breaks when I grab thing") are much more likely to get overlooked and skimmed over
- **Be succint, but to the point**, because we tackle a lot of issues. Imagine you have just 30 seconds to sell us on why something is a good idea to put our time towards to. If we need to read long paragraphs or watch a long video to understand, we are much less likely to prioritize given issue
- **Be specific** when possible, becaues vague statements can be hard to interpret. For example instead of "It took a long time to finish", say "It took about 30 minutes to finish". "Long" can mean different amounts in different contexts - for some things a minute is long time, for others an hour is short
- **Provide accurate updates** if something changes with the issue, which makes the original sample or reproduction steps work, but issue still persists with other cases, make sure to include the information with your updates
- **Do not refer to projects we worked on in the past** we're unable to use materials or issues from past projects.

**FAILURE TO MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN THE ISSUE GOING UNADDRESSED/BEING CLOSED IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME**

# How we prioritize issues
We use a number of factors when prioritizing issues. If you'd like to learn more and help increase the likelihood that your issue gets addressed, [read our HOW_WE_PRIORITIZE document here](HOW_WE_PRIORITIZE.md).
